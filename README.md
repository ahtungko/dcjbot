â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt     # Lists all Python dependencies

â”‚
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ config.py        # Central configuration for bot settings
    â””â”€â”€ cogs/            # Each major feature is a "Cog"
        â”œâ”€â”€ ai_chat.py   # Handles the Gemini AI mentions

ðŸš€ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the bot running on your own server.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or newer

A Discord Bot Token

A Google Gemini API Key

2. Clone the Repository
Clone this project to your local machine:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd your-bot-project

3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root of your project directory. This file will hold your secret credentials. Never share this file or commit it to version control.

Copy the following into your .env file and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

# .env

# Your Discord bot's unique token
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"

# Your API key from Google AI Studio
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

# Your personal Discord User ID (optional, for owner-only commands like !test)
BOT_OWNER_ID="YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID"
